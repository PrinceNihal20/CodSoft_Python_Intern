Secure Password Generator
This is a full-stack web application designed to generate strong, customizable, and random passwords. The core generation logic is handled by a Python Flask backend, while the user interface and interaction are managed by a modern HTML/Tailwind CSS frontend.

‚ú® Features
Customizable Length: Users can select a password length between 6 and 64 characters using a range slider.

Complexity Options: Allows users to include/exclude:

Uppercase letters (A-Z)

Numbers (0-9)

Symbols (!@#$%^&*, etc.)

Real-time Generation: Generates a new password upon request via an API call to the Flask server.

Copy Functionality: Easily copy the generated password to the clipboard with a single click.

Responsive Design: Optimized for display on both desktop and mobile devices.

üíª Technologies Used
Backend
Python 3: Core programming language.

Flask: Lightweight web framework for handling the API endpoint.

Flask-CORS: Used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing the frontend (on a different port) to access the backend API.

Frontend
HTML5: Structure of the web application.

Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling and responsive design.

JavaScript (ES6+): Handles user interactions, API calls, and displaying the generated password.

üöÄ Setup and Running Instructions
To run this project, you need to start the Python backend server first, and then open the HTML frontend in your browser.

1. Backend Setup (password_generator_server.py)
Install Python: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

Install Dependencies: Open your terminal and install the required packages:

pip install flask flask-cors

Run the Server: Navigate to the directory containing password_generator_server.py and execute the script:

python password_generator_server.py

The server will start and run on http://localhost:5000. Keep this terminal window open.

2. Frontend Access (index.html)
The frontend must be accessed via a local web server (like VS Code's Live Server extension) so it can successfully communicate with the Flask API.

Install VS Code Extension: If you are using VS Code, install the Live Server extension (by Ritwick Dey).

Open the HTML File: Right-click on the index.html file in your editor or file explorer.

Launch: Select Open with Live Server.

The web application will open in your browser, and the "Generate Password" button will now successfully communicate with the Python backend running on port 5000.

üõ†Ô∏è Usage
Set Length: Move the Password Length slider to the desired value (e.g., 20).

Select Complexity: Check the boxes for Uppercase Letters, Numbers, and Symbols to include them in the generated password.

Generate: Click the Generate Password button.

Copy: Click the copy icon next to the generated password to quickly save it to your clipboard.
