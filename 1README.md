üìù Python CLI To-Do List Manager
A simple yet effective command-line application for managing your daily tasks. This project demonstrates fundamental Python programming concepts, including list manipulation, file I/O (using JSON for persistence), and building a basic command-line interface (CLI).

View Tasks: Display all tasks with their unique IDs and completion status.

Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks to your list.

Toggle Status: Mark tasks as COMPLETE or PENDING.

Delete Tasks: Permanently remove tasks from the list using their ID.

Data Persistence: All tasks are automatically saved to a local file (todo.json) and reloaded the next time you run the app.

üöÄ How to Run
Requirements
You only need Python 3.x installed on your system.

Steps
